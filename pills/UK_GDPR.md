## Introduction
---
Organisations regularly obtain, retain, and utilise data for various purposes. These purposes include:

- Gathering customer information for order processing.
- Human resources departments engaging in recruitment and employment activities.
- Managers extracting information to make decisions based on evidence.

When such data pertains to individuals, organisations must adhere to the legislation governing data protection:
- The UK General Data Protection Regulation (**UK GDPR**) and 
- The **Data Protection Act 2018**.

These laws aim to strike a fair balance. On one hand, organisations have a legitimate need to collect, retain, and use data for valid business purposes. On the other hand, individuals have rights regarding the usage of their data. The GDPR recognises that personal data is a valuable asset that organisations must safeguard and use ethically.

## Personal data and special category data
---
In broad terms, personal data is information that relates to individuals. However, under the data
protection laws that apply in the UK, there are two main types of personal data, and organisations
must treat them slightly differently:
- Personal data
- Special category data

### Personal data
Personal data means data you can use to identify a living individual. This is sometimes called
**personally identifiable information (PII)**. When you are working within an organisation, this can include information such as 
- a customer name
- a client address
- an employee salary banding
- the email address of a business contact 
or even a combination of two or more of these items that together can be used to identify a living individual.

Personal data does not need to be ‘private’ information. Even information which is in the public
domain or relates to an individual’s professional role can be considered personal data, including data an individual shares on social media or their inclusion on the public voting register.
Personal data can relate to individuals inside or outside your organisation, and in addition to more obvious examples such as names, telephone numbers, social media profiles, and email addresses,
it can include (besides many other examples) CV s, company databases, photos, CCTV and voice
recordings, and the IP addresses and GPS data for electronic devices.

### Special category data
Some, more **sensitive personal data** is classified as special category data, including information that relates to an individual’s: 
- race
- ethnic origin
- religion 
- sex life or sexual orientation
- political opinions
- health
- trade union memberships and 
- genetic or 
- biometric data.

This data requires even stronger protection because it puts individuals at risk of unlawful
discrimination, and usually requires the express consent of the individual before it can be processed.
Data relating to criminal records also requires stronger safeguards, though this is not technically
classified as special category data. Special category data can be found in many places, including
credit check reports, census information and job applications.

## An organisation’s responsibilities
---
Personal data must be **accurate, kept up to date**, and **stored only for as long as it is needed**.
Organisations must ensure that personal data is only collected when it is needed for specific
business purposes, and that it is not used for other, incompatible purposes. Organisations must
therefore avoid collecting more information than they need, and only employees who require access to personal data, should be given access.

When gathering personal data, businesses must present an easy-to-understand Privacy Notice.
This must be clear and include: the purposes for processing the data; how long it will be stored;
and with whom it will be shared. 

**Special category data** requires stronger protection because it puts individuals at risk of
unlawful discrimination, and usually requires the express consent of the individual before it can be processed.\
Data relating to criminal records also requires stronger safeguards.
The GDPR gives individuals the right to access their personal data by making subject access
requests verbally or in writing. This means they typically have the right to see emails or documents that mention them personally.\
*Businesses* must action these requests within one month. *Public bodies* should be particularly mindful, as the Freedom of Information Act 2000 means almost any data they hold could be made public.

Most organisations that use personal data must now keep an up-to-date written record of their data processing activities and register with the **Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO)**. The ICO enforces the GDPR and lists registered organisations online in their Data Protection Public Register.

## Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO)
---
The Information Commissioner's Office is an independent authority in the UK responsible for enforcing data protection laws and promoting individuals' information rights. It provides guidance, investigates complaints, and ensures organisations handle personal data responsibly.

As interpretations and compliance advice can change over time, you should visit the **[ICO website](https://ico.org.uk/)** for an up-to-date guidance and the most current and detailed information on the DPA 2018 and UK GDPR.

## The seven principles of GDPR
---
The UK GDPR is fundamentally based on principles rather than hard and fast rules. A strong understanding of these principles is essential as they underpin everything else.
These principles are

1. Lawfulness, fairness and transparency
1. Purpose limitation
1. Data minimisation
1. Accuracy
1. Storage limitation
1. Integrity and confidentiality (security)
1. Accountability

### 1. Lawfulness, fairness and transparency

- Personal data must be processed in accordance with the law. For example, obtaining explicit consent from individuals before collecting their data.

- Data processing should be fair and not prejudicial to the individual's rights. For instance, treating all individuals equally and not discriminating based on their personal characteristics.

- Individuals should be informed about how their data will be used. This can be done through privacy policies, consent forms, or providing clear and accessible information about data processing practices.


### 2. Purpose limitation
- Personal data should be collected for specific and legitimate purposes. 
For example, collecting email addresses for the purpose of sending a newsletter and not using them for unrelated marketing campaigns.
- Data should not be processed in a manner incompatible with the original purpose. If the data is later used for a different purpose, obtaining additional consent may be required.

### 3. Data minimisation
- Only collect and process personal data that is necessary for the intended purpose. For instance, if an online store only needs a customer's name and shipping address, they should not request additional unnecessary information.
- Avoid retaining personal data for longer than necessary. Once the data is no longer needed, it should be securely deleted or anonymised.

### 4. Accuracy
- Personal data should be accurate, and efforts should be made to keep it up to date. For example, providing a mechanism for individuals to update their personal information or regularly reviewing and correcting data if errors are identified.

### 5. Storage limitation
- Personal data should only be kept for as long as necessary for the purpose it was collected. For instance, a financial institution may have a legal obligation to retain customer transaction records for a certain period, but they should not retain the data indefinitely once that period has elapsed.

### 6. Integrity and confidentiality (security)
- Personal data should be processed securely and protected against unauthorised access, loss, or damage. This can involve implementing encryption, access controls, regular security assessments, and employee training on data protection best practices.

### 7. Accountability
- **[Data controller](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/controllers-and-processors/what-are-controllers-and-processors/#2)** are responsible for complying with the principles of the UK GDPR and must be able to demonstrate their compliance. This may include maintaining documentation of data processing activities, conducting data protection impact assessments, and having appropriate policies and procedures in place to ensure compliance.

## Privacy by Design
Privacy by Design is an approach that puts privacy considerations at the forefront of any project or system design. Instead of treating privacy as an add-on or fixing privacy issues later, it integrates privacy protections from the very beginning. It involves considering privacy implications, implementing safeguards, and providing individuals with control over their personal data throughout the entire development process.

The main idea behind Privacy by Design is to be proactive rather than reactive when it comes to privacy. It means building systems, processes, and products with privacy in mind from the start, rather than trying to retrofit privacy measures afterwards. Privacy is considered a fundamental requirement, and measures such as default privacy settings, transparency, user control, and strong security are embedded into the design.

Privacy by Design ensures that privacy is not compromised for the sake of functionality or convenience. It seeks to strike a balance between privacy protection and the seamless functionality of systems and products. It also emphasizes the importance of user awareness and control, empowering individuals with knowledge and choices regarding the use and handling of their personal data.





## Implications for you
---
In your role you have a high level of responsibility for ensuring that you understand and comply with the DPA and UK GDPR. When dealing with personal and sensitive personal data, you are normally acting as a **[data processor](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/controllers-and-processors/what-are-controllers-and-processors/#4)**, which has a specific legal definition and conveys additional responsibility.
A data processor does not control the data, nor do they own the data and they are required to operate to the instructions provided by the data controller (usually your organisation). This means that a data processor cannot change the purpose for which the data was collected and the purpose for what it is to be used.
Additionally, directors or managers may be held personally responsible if breaches of the law occur with their consent or through their neglect, and individual employees may be prosecuted if they release or obtain information without authority.
