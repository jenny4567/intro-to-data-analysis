# Data and Ethics

* Recognise the importance of crafting your own mindset to be an ethical data engineer.
* Reflect on your own relationship to privacy and data, both for yourself and when relating to others.
* Identify some actions to take forward to 'keep yourself in check' as you shape a more ethical mindset.

# The Right Mindset

The starting point for any software engineer should be the mindset that we approach our engineering from.

At Makers, we talk a lot about growth mindset. Although this is essential in the context of a learner learning, it isn't necessarily the case when it comes to the engineer engineering.

This discussion becomes especially significant in the context of data engineering. Not only because you may be handling personal or sensitive data, but also because of the growth of AI and other data-related technologies that have a direct impact on societal control.

When you are building apps and websites as an engineer, the problems you will be solving will often be 'customer-focused' i.e. ultimately, based on the needs and wants of the user (they like blue buttons, or swiping left rather than right) or efficiency (using state rather than passing data to the server will make this site more responsive).

However, as a data engineer, you are more distant from the customer so you are more likely to be responsive to the business needs rather than the consumer. Without the right mindset, and ultimately the right business objectives, the way you extract and use data can lead to harm.

# The Importance of Ethics

This is why ethics is a seriously important consideration as a data engineer. And this is not just data protection (e.g. whether you share personal data with others) though that does come in to it. It's about engineering with a mindset that is reflective, compassionate and community-centred. 

*That means that you consider yourself a user just like anyone else, and that you see yourself as one part of a connected community made of those just like you.* With those reflections, the decisions that you make over time regarding data will result in data systems that are sustainable, ethical and continue to grow (rather than, for example, having thousands of complaints and lawsuits to deal with!).

# Time to Reflect

With these thoughts, take a moment to reflect on your own relationship with data as a user. 

* How happy are you for your personal data to be shared with other parties? 
* Where do you draw the line on what to share with a company? 
* How do you decide in your personal life who to share personal news with - do you have a logical process, or is it by intuition? 
* How do you approach getting information that you really want to know, even if you know it is going to be difficult to get it? 

These are important questions that will help you shape your understanding of your relationship to data, and use it as a baseline to create more ethical systems of belief.

> We will run a further `Ethics and Data` workshop in due course.
