## Introduction
---
When you are getting involved in a Data Analytics project, it is easy to get lost in the data. A well-defined process can help to guide any analytical project by break large projects into smaller pieces
The data analytics lifecycle is a framework for guiding the process of deriving insights and value from data. It outlines the stages involved in extracting, processing, and analysing data to support decision-making and drive business outcomes. The data analytics lifecycle typically consists of the following stages:

1. **Business understanding**
This stage involves identifying the business problem, goal, or opportunity that data analytics can help address. It includes understanding the context, defining objectives, and determining the key performance indicators (KPIs) that will be used to measure success.
1. **Data understanding**
This stage involves gathering and exploring the data to understand its structure, quality, and relevance to the business problem. This may include data profiling, descriptive statistics, and data visualisation to identify patterns and relationships.
1. **Data preparation**
In this stage, the data is cleaned, transformed, and enriched to improve its quality and make it suitable for analysis. This may involve handling missing values, outliers, or inconsistencies, as well as integrating data from multiple sources and transforming variables to ensure compatibility.
1. **Data modeling**
This stage involves selecting appropriate analytical techniques and building models to analyse the data. The choice of techniques depends on the problem and the data. Examples include regression analysis, clustering, classification, or time-series analysis. The model building typically involves feature selection, training, and validation to ensure that the model is accurate and generalisable.
1. **Model evaluation**
Once the models are built, they are evaluated for their performance, accuracy, and relevance to the business problem. This stage involves comparing different models, selecting the best one(s), and fine-tuning the model parameters to optimise performance.
1. **Model deployment**
After selecting the best model, it is deployed into a production environment to generate insights and predictions. This stage involves integrating the model into existing systems, processes, and workflows, as well as monitoring and maintaining the model to ensure its ongoing effectiveness.
1. **Results interpretation and communication**
The final stage of the data analytics lifecycle involves interpreting the results generated by the model, drawing conclusions, and communicating the insights to relevant stakeholders. This may involve creating visualisations, dashboards, or reports to convey the findings effectively and providing recommendations for action based on the insights.

Throughout the data analytics lifecycle, it is crucial to have a strong collaboration between domain experts, data analysts, and business stakeholders to ensure the analytics project aligns with business goals and delivers meaningful insights.
