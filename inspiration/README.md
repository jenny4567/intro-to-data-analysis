It's hosted on Coursera for free, but you need to sign up to view the content.
- :newspaper: Want some more advanced tips on how you could play with the data? [Here's an article from Google](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/guides/good-data-analysis) on how to do "good data analysis".

### Using Python, `pandas`, and `matplotlib`

- :toolbox: Need a simple overview of Python? [Here's a cheat sheet](https://github.com/pavry/Cheat-Sheet-for-Data-Analysts/blob/master/Data%20Analyzing/Python/Python%20Basic.pdf).
- :toolbox: Need a simple overview of all the basic `pandas` functions in one place? [Here's a cheat sheet](http://datacamp-community-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/f04456d7-8e61-482f-9cc9-da6f7f25fc9b).

### Visualising data

- :toolbox: Want to understand a bunch of different ways to visualise your data? [Here's the Data Visualisation Catalogue](https://datavizcatalogue.com/). It's an interactive website with example visualisations, and guides on when and how to use them. You can also search visualisations by the sort of thing you want to communicate.
- :toolbox: Want to know how to make all those cool visualisations using Python? Here's the [Python Graph Gallery](https://www.python-graph-gallery.com/), a cool library of visualisations with the code for each.
- :toolbox: Want to make your visualisations easier to understand? [Here are two cheat sheets](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/08/data-visualization-cheatsheet.html) to help you simplify your visualisations.

### Divining Insights
