# Your first analysis question

Learn about the importance of formulating analysis questions.

## Introduction

Data analysis starts with questions, not data or a technique.

There’s always a motivation to analyse data. Formulating your needs as questions or hypotheses helps ensure that you are choosing the right data to look at and thinking about the possible gaps in the data. 
Often, the questions you ask will evolve as you look at the data. However, analysis without a question will end up aimless.

## Learning Objectives

In this series of exercises, we'll simplify the process of deciding on the right question and the right dataset by giving you:

- a specific analysis question
- a specific dataset to answer it with
- a set of steps to follow to answer the question 
- an awareness of the Data Analytics Life Cycle

Later on in this module, you'll work in a freer, more exploratory way, but for now we'll keep things simple so that you can focus on picking up some of the most common data manipulation techniques in pandas.

## Intermezzo - Data Analytics Life Cycle

Throughout this module we will be exploring data using our new found skills with `pandas`, but as we go through, it is essential that we have some awareness of how we are exploring data in relation to the Data Analytics Life Cycle.

Much in a similar way to the Software Development Life Cycle you may have touched upon during the first 8 weeks of the bootcamp, the process of best practice whilst exploring and analysing data has clearly defined steps.

The data analytics lifecycle typically consists of the following stages:

![data_lifecycle.png](../pills/assets/data_analytics_lifecycle.png)

1. **Business understanding**
This stage involves identifying the business problem, goal, or opportunity that data analytics can help address. 
1. **Data understanding**
This stage involves gathering and exploring the data to understand its structure, quality, and relevance to the business problem. 
1. **Data preparation**
In this stage, the data is cleaned, transformed, and enriched to improve its quality and make it suitable for analysis. 
1. **Data modeling**
This stage involves selecting appropriate analytical techniques and building models to analyse the data. The choice of techniques depends on the problem and the data. 
1. **Model evaluation**
Once the models are built, they are evaluated for their performance, accuracy, and relevance to the business problem.
1. **Model deployment**
After selecting the best model, it is deployed into a production environment to generate insights and predictions. 
1. **Results interpretation and communication**
The final stage of the data analytics lifecycle involves interpreting the results generated by the model, drawing conclusions, and communicating the insights to relevant stakeholders.

You will need to be able to explain these steps as you progress towards the end of your apprenticeship. For now, it is adequate to simply have a high-level understanding of the process. You will notice some references to the Data Analytics Life Cycle.

For more in-depth exploration of the Data Analytics Life Cycle, refer to [this pill here](../pills/data_analytics_life_cycle.md), or visit `../pills/data_analytics_life_cycle.md`. 

>You may want to **make note of these steps** and this file for future reference later on down the line during your apprenticeship.

You will find markers throughout this module that refer to where we are in the Data Analytics Life Cycle. They will look like this:

## Exercise One

In this exercise we will be loading some simple data that needs little to no preparation in order for us to be able to draw conclusions fairly quickly.

Open up the `WorldCups.csv` file located in `data/extra-challenge/world_cup/` folder and have a look at the data.

A `.csv` file stands for Comma Separated Values, and is how the columns are partitioned.

### The Question

Based on previous winners, can you predict which nation is most likely to take home the FIFA World Cup in 2018?

 - N.B. We of course *know* which nation really won the World Cup in 2018. Did the prediction match reality?
 - As a follow up task, how does this info ([World Cup results](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup#Results)) affect the prediction for subsequent competitions? 
 - Who is most likely to win in 2026?

 #### *DALC - 01 BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING.*
 - [Click here for more Data Analytics Life Cycle detail.](../pills/data_analytics_life_cycle.md#1---business-understanding)

### The data

You can find the small dataset in the `data/extra-challenge/world_cup/` folder. Or by clicking [here](../data/extra-challenge/world_cup/WorldCups.csv).

If you are struggling to view the file, you may want to enable some VS Code extensions.

Some handy ones are:

- [RAINBOW CSV](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mechatroner.rainbow-csv) - This colourises the columns of your comma separated values.

- [EDIT CSV](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=janisdd.vscode-edit-csv) - For some more editing powers and signal from our `.csv` files.

## Conclusion

For this section, write a sentence or two in markdown inside your Jupyter Notebook. You can do this by pressing the plus symbol below the code cell and choosing markdown. 

Set a timer for 5 minutes.

 - How did you arrive at your conclusion? 
 - What pieces of data informed your decision? 
 - Could the data be interpreted in another way to answer the question differently?

These are all things we are going to cover in due course - the first step is always, asking the question. This will, undoubtedly, lead to further questions - and it is these questions where we begin to target and interrogate the data for answers.

After answering these questions. Make a note in markdown of the following:

 - Which nation has won the most World Cups?
 - Which nation has come runner-up the most times?
 - Which nations have never won a World Cup?
 - Therefore; which nation is the best and which nation is the worst at football?

The difference in these answers is key to understanding the inherent issues within data analysis. Where the quantitive empirical data can be wielded one way to tell one story, and yet another way to tell a different story.
