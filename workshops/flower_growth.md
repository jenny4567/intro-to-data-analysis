# Flower Growth Introductory Workshop

## Introduction

Predictive Statistics can be a challenging topic initially. Partly due to the conceptual nature that is inherent in taking lots of data and manipulating it to predict outcomes, and partly due to the many factors, models, and terminology that is required to understand how to wield Predictive Statistical Analysis to answer questions put to us.

However, at it's very core, we can break down the objective of Predictive Statistical Analysis into and exploration of relationships between Data, and the inferences we can make from the knowledge of that relationship.

## Sunflower Power

Let's start with a really simple idea, and apply some of the Predictive Statistical Analysis concepts.

Let us imagine we have planted a Sunflower in a garden. With all this water and sunshine, it's growing so fast I can't quite believe it.

I want to chart it's growth.

Let's head over to the [Flower Growth Notebook](./flower_growth.ipynb) and start our exploration (and prediction!)
