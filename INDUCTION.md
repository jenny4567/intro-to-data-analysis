# Induction

Welcome to Data Engineering!

This is your induction. There are two parts:

1. **The induction kickoff.**
   Your coach will take you through this. You can review the contents below.
2. **Data and Ethics document.**  
   You will have a chance to go through this. [You can review the contents here.](./pills/data_and_ethics.md)

## Induction Workshop

Your coach will take you through this, so you don't need to review this section

### What you're preparing for

Your coach will talk to you about what data Engineering is and what data engineering jobs are like
day-to-day. They will draw out some key points:

- **Data Engineers help organisations make better decisions based on data.**
  These days, most organisations collect and produce large amounts of data relating to their operations and how users interact with their services.
  Extracting insights from this data can be extremely useful for understanding how to improve and develop business ideas.
  But often extracting these insights is difficult.
  Data is messy, comes from many different sources and ends up stored in many different places in many different formats.
  Data engineers use their software engineering skills to design and build the infrastructure, automations, systems and tools to make an organisation's data trustworthy, meaningful and easily accessible across the organisation.


  
- **The Data field is varied.**
  There are many different roles in the Data space that sometimes overlap, but overall the goals are the same and it's useful to have some exposure to all the different parts of the data lifecycle. 
  This is why your training will cover not just modern engineering practices for processing data but also developing your data analysis skills.

- **You will work closely with other roles.**
  You already know that software engineers rarely work alone but rather as part of a team of other engineers.
  This is also the case for data engineers and in fact data engineers have the opportunity to work even more closely with colleagues from across the organisation.
  That's because fundamentally, data engineers build systems _for_ their colleagues, which are not necessarily technical 
  The work that data engineers do helps data analysts, data scientists, product managers, marketing and many others do their jobs better by giving them access to the data they need to make decisions.

- **You have a responsibility to be a good steward of other people's data.**
  Data can be used for laudable purposes.
  But not all data should be universally accessible to everyone who might be interested.
  It's also easy to make very bad, damaging decisions based on data.

	You'll have a change to reflect on this and discuss issues of privacy with the group as part of the [Data & Ethics workshop](./pills/data_and_ethics.md). Your coach will let you know when this workshop will be held.

### Mutual expectations

[All of the expectations from the software course still apply](https://github.com/makersacademy/induction#mutual-expectations).


### What this course covers

[Find the module outline for this course here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oShBZ89SAuTLF4KRgCiQbhN0rxQioYVimehSeJAgJ2g/edit#)

### What's different about this course

In every module in this course, you'll acquire some new knowledge and skills in the field of data engineering and data analysis
through a mixture of practical exercises, challenges as well as by applying them to realistic, open-ended business scenarios.


### How to measure your progress on this course

There is a lot of rather difficult analysis and attention to detail required in this module, and on this section of course. You are not expected to remember every detail, and should measure your progress against the learning objectives set out in the various chapters. 

### Schedule

For the next two weeks you will be working on this module, Intro To Data Analysis. The topics will be varied and should give you a good introduction to the world of Data Analysis, before we move on to more Data Engineering focused modules.

### Get Started

You may peruse the [Data and Ethics](./pills/data_and_ethics.md) document at your discretion, and when you are ready - move onto [Introduction to the module](./01_introduction.md).
