We will only be able to sample the population and use our measurements of that _sample_ to talk about the _whole_ _population_. How should sample size affect our confidence when we use only the sample to reach conclusions? For instance: how accurate would the estimate of the mean be? \n",
    "\n",

    "For our investigation: \n",
    "- start off by keeping the population size the same (it starts at 100)\n",
    "- vary the sample size (as a percentage of the population) and compare the sample mean to the real mean of the population. The program actually chooses 10 samples and reports on the biggest error.\n",
    "- how big does the sample need to be so that the percentage error is small? Say about 2%\n"
