The above was in base `10`, but a common alternative is the `natural logarithm` which is in a different base. Most calculators will mean base `10` when they say `log`, and `natural logarithm` when they say `ln`. But python means `natural logarithm` when it says `log` (although you can add a base parameter - read the documentation).\n",
