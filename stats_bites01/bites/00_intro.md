# Using statistics to describe and summarise data

## Learning objectives
By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Describe the challenges of working with large amounts of data
- Explain the purpose of various summaries of data
- Explain why the summaries on their own can be misleading
- Measure the relationship between two columns of data in a table

## Introduction

The aim of statistics is to help people make good decisions, based on data. For example: how effective is a medicine when prescribed for a condition? Is the climate changing due to human activity?

This phase of the course aims to give you the skills to make sense of data. When given a large amount of data we often need to create a summary of it which is not misleading. Any summary will, of course, leave out some details. So it is important to understand the limits of what the summary can tell us.

We will be using `pandas`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib` and `numpy` in `Jupyter` notebooks

The module is split into these chapters:
- [Samples and populations](./01_SamplesAndPopulations.md)
- [Descriptive statistics](./02_DescriptiveStatistics.md)
- [Calculating the mean, median and mode](./03_CalculatingMeanMedianAndMode.md)
- [Other percentiles](./04_Other_Percentiles.md)
- [Correlation Coeffition](./05_CorrelationCoefficient.md)
- [Visualising data](./06_Visualising.md)
- [Correlation and Causation](./07_CorrelationAndCausation.md)



[Next Challenge](01_SamplesAndPopulations.md)
