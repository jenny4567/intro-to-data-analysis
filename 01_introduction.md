# Introduction to the Module

In today's data-driven world, the ability to analyse and interpret data has
become a critical skill for professionals in a variety of industries.

Whether you're working in finance, marketing, healthcare, or any other field,
being able to make sense of data and draw insights from it can help you make
better decisions and drive business outcomes.

In this module, you'll explore some of the key concepts and techniques used in
data analysis, including data cleaning, data transformation, data visualisation
and statistical methods.

You will learn to use some popular tools and technologies used in data analysis,
such as Python, pandas, and Jupyter notebooks.

Throughout the module, you will work with real-world datasets and apply the
techniques you learn to solve practical problems.

## A note for data engineers taking this module

Data analysis skills are important whether or not you end up working in a formal
data analyst role. If you are training to be a data engineer (i.e. an engineer
that build data processing systems), you will greatly benefit from a grasp of
data analysis concepts and techniques, as it will allow you "know your users",
understand the challenges they face and build what they need.

You'll be able to work collaboratively with data analysts to ensure that data is
correctly transformed, processed, and stored, enabling accurate and insightful
analysis. 

## Key terms

- **Dataset**  
  A dataset is a collection of data. Datasets come in many formats and sizes and
  can be stored in different places.

  In this module, you'll start by working with relatively small datasets stored
  in files that you will download to your laptop.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  EDA is the process of investigating the dataset to discover patterns, and
  anomalies (outliers), and form hypotheses based on our understanding of the
  dataset.

  EDA often involves creating graphs, plots, and other visualisations as well as
  using statistical methods to summarise numerical data with the aim of
  understanding the data better.

  In this module, you'll be learning to perform an exploratory data analysis to
  shed light on a business problem.

- **Pandas**  
  [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is a powerful and extremely popular open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language. 
  
  In this module, you'll use pandas to load, transform and visualise data.
- **Matplotlib**  
  [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) is a comprehensive library for creating all kinds of visualisations in Python. It works together with pandas.

- **Jupyter Notebooks** Jupyter Notebooks, often simply referred to as
  "notebooks", are interactive documents that contain both code (e.g. Python)
  and the outputs of running the code.

  Writing code in a Jupyter Notebook is a popular choice among data analysts as
  it allows them to keep data processing code and the resulting visualisation
  together and share them with other people.

  If you're finding this hard to imagine, you can actually [try out using a Jupyter Notebook in your browser](https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/).

  You'll be writing your data analysis code in Jupyter Notebooks in this module.

## Challenge Submissions

As per the previous modules you have done with us at Makers, there will be challenge submissions throughout this, and subsequent modules.

In previous modules we required video submission of the entire challenge attempt, often in order for us to assess engineering processes and good practice, over solution oriented feedback.

That is not entirely necessary for this section of the course. You will come to work in <kbd>Jupyter Notebooks</kbd>, which consist of python/SQL code and markdown.

The markdown sections are there for you to explain and contextualise, in text format, your code and solutions.

For the challenges hereon in, we request you submit a video of you running the cells are presenting the markdown (really you need only read through your work). This is sufficient for us to see your implementation of the various Data Exploration and Statistical Analysis.

If you hit a bug whilst recording - **keep recording**, it is interesting and helpful to us to see how you overcome these bugs.

In summary, no need to record your entire challenge. Record a short video of you running the cells one by one, and discussing the results and the markdown.

When submitting, you may submit both the Notebook and the video submission.

## How to think about the learning of this module

During this module, you may notice a shift in style from the previous modules you have completed during your time at Makers. 

This module, by necessity, is by and large quite theory heavy. The Statistical Analysis sections contain large amounts of information that to some of you will be new, and to others will revisit topics you may have covered a long time ago.

By no means do we expect you to be able to recite the complex mathematical machinations behind the equations and algorithms at use during this module. 

Your goal, as junior Data Engineers, is to be able to ascertain which tool best fits which task, and as such, understand the practical differences between them.

We will endeavour to provide actionable, pragmatic applications of these Statistical Analysis concepts, but bear in mind that there are aspects of this module that simply must be accepted and employed - there is little time to take a detour into the pure maths behind some of these concepts, and it would bear you little reward in the practical application as we set you up for the world of Data Engineering in industry.

By all means, if it helps you understand something, do your own research to bolster your own comprehension, but as a word of caution, try not to get too bogged down in the fine details of the maths of it all. We are, after all, learning which tool best fit which task; not studying the intricacies of the tools themselves.

## How to use this module

This module can be worked through sequentially, with challenges and exercises as you have already experienced them.

It may be pertinent at certain points to refer back to previous examples and exercises for points on particular pieces of syntax, or methods. This is understood and widely encouraged. You are not expected to memorise the various nuances of scientific python libraries, this would be a poor use of your cognitive load, and time.

There are various pills on important aspects of Data Analysis and Engineering, touching on GDPR, Anonymisation, the Data Lifecycle and the Data Analytical Lifecycle. Whilst not immediately required for advancing through the module, these documents will serve you greatly further down the line in your jobs, towards the end of your apprenticeship for projects, and for EPA (should you be taking this course as part of an Apprenticeship). As such, mark their location, you may want to return to them.

There is more detail on challenge submissions previously in this documents, and whilst you can expect timely feedback from your coaches, please bear in mind we may have quite a few submissions to give feedback on - if there is something in particular you would like to highlight to use, we would appreciate the direction.

Whilst more heavy in theory, there are many exercises, that, like in Software Engineering, may be achievable in a multitude of ways. No one way is 100% correct, there are nuances to each approach, and we will aim to convey this in feedback and workshops.

### Next up

Either head straight to "[Setting up your data analysis environment](./pandas_bites/01_set_up_data_analysis_environment_bite.md)" to begin the `Pandas` section, 
or back to [the README](./README.md) for more overview.
